									<p>Each time we turn and face the sky to feel the pleasant rays of
										sunlight warming our face, it can feel weird to remember where this
										relaxing sensation comes from. It is the result of an immensely powerful
										release of energy from a star over 100 times the size of our entire
										planet which has made its way through millions of kilometres of space to
										reach us. Our sun, like all stars in the universe, are fuelled to burn
										for billions of years by the phenomenal release of energy upon the
										combination of atomic nuclei known as fusion. It can be hard to imagine
										that this chaotic creation of energy could ever be harnessed on earth to
										power our cities; and yet we are attempting exactly that. This article
										looks to describe the essential fusion mechanism and apply it to
										examples of real-world fusion reactors like Tokamaks and inertial
										confinement facilities.</p>
										<h3 id="the-fusion-mechanism">The Fusion Mechanism:</h3>
										<p>At its core, fusion is the joining together of atomic nuclei to
										create one larger nucleus. This process can either release or absorb
										energy depending on the change in nuclear binding energy per nucleon
										during fusion. Nuclear binding energy is the energy required to
										disassemble a nucleus into the free, unbound nucleons (neutrons and
										protons) it is composed of. The higher the average binding energy per
										nucleon, the more energy is required to separate it and so it is more
										stable. Increasing this energy consequently results in a release in
										energy as the nucleus has reached a more stable state. This release of
										energy is what makes the fusion reaction so important. It also presents
										itself in the mass defect of a fusion reaction where the amount of
										energy loss is proportional to the amount of mass lost by the speed of
										light squared.</p>
										<p>The value of the nuclear binding energy itself is
										determined by the balancing of two factors within the nucleus, the first
										being the strong nuclear force. It is a complex quantum interaction that
										binds nucleons together through an incredibly strong force, however, it
										is very short range and so becomes negligible for any interaction other
										than that between neighbouring nucleons. As more nucleons are added,
										this force becomes more effective as each nucleon is surrounded very
										closely by more nucleons so the energy of the system decreases. However,
										it is not always energetically favourable to add more nucleons to the
										nucleus due to the electrostatic repulsion forces between the protons.
										This force is weaker by a significant amount when compared to the strong
										nuclear force however it acts over a much longer range. The result is
										that in larger nuclei, increasing the number of nucleons is less
										energetically favourable as the repulsive forces between distant protons
										outweighs the strong nuclear forces of attraction. This relationship is
										seen in a graph showing the trend in nuclear binding energy per nucleon.
										Keep in mind that a larger nuclear binding energy per nucleon means that
										more energy must be put into the nucleus per nucleon to disassemble it
										meaning that it must be in a lower energy state.</p>
										<img src="images/nuclearFusion/nfig4.png" style="width: 500px; height: auto;" />
										<p>It happens to be that Ni-62 has the perfect balance of strong nuclear force
										and nuclear radius to make it the most stable nucleus. For atoms with
										smaller nuclei, the average binding energy increases as more nucleons
										are added so energy is released in this way. As nucleon number continues
										to increase average binding energy per nucleon begins to decreases which
										requires an input of energy. On this side of the graph, it is the
										reverse fission process that yields a release of energy. As we can see
										by the gradient of this graph, fusion yields a much greater release of
										energy than fission does. </p>
										<h3 id="how-it-is-achieved-on-earth">How it is achieved on Earth:</h3>
										<p>The enormous release of energy from the combination of a few tiny
										particles seems to be an incredibly efficient source of power that could
										fuel our planet’s growing hunger for power with ease. To achieve fusion
										on Earth we encounter one small problem, how can we recreate the extreme
										conditions at the centre of a star. It is the immensely high pressure
										and temperature at the centre of the star which creates an environment
										that allows fusion to occur. The enormous mass of the sun means that it
										is almost impossible to consistently maintain similar pressures on our
										planet so we compensate for this by using a much higher temperature to
										initiate fusion. Currently there are two very promising methods of
										fusion that are both seeing results and receiving a large amount of
										funding that we will look at in this article.</p>
										<h3 id="tokamaks">Tokamaks:</h3>
										<p>When heating any fuel to temperatures hotter than the core of the sun
										it becomes a “fourth state of matter” called plasma. This is described
										as a “soup” of positively charged particles and electrons which have
										been separated from each other. The soup of incredibly hot particles is
										unsurprisingly very hard to contain and moves around at great speeds,
										disintegrating anything it comes into contact with which isn’t very
										practical for building reactors around. The solution tokamaks offer is a
										toroidal (donut-shaped) vacuum chamber controlled by a powerful magnetic
										field created by coils of superconducting magnets. These magnets confine
										the plasma fuel into a whirling ring so that the nuclear reaction can
										occur in a more controlled manner.</p>
										<img src="images/nuclearFusion/nfig5.png" style="width: 500px; height: auto;" /><p>-The plasma chamber of
										the TCV tokamak in Switzerland</p>
										<p>The charged plasma tends to follow field lines as if the particles
										move perpendicular to the field lines they move in a circle around it
										(Force perpendicular to direction of motion) however they experience no
										force when moving parallel to the field lines so overall they travel
										around the torus in a helical path. Field lines around the torus are
										produced by superconducting electromagnets wrapped around the torus. The
										issue with this is the difference in magnetic field strength as in the
										centre of the torus field lines are closer together and so the magnetic
										field is stronger than the outside of the torus. Plasma particles are
										affected by the field in non-uniform ways which results in instability
										so the plasma ring does not last long enough for fusion to occur. To
										keep the plasma in a stable shape, a current is passed through the
										middle of it which creates circular magnetic field lines around the
										torus. These two magnetic fields combine to create twisted magnetic
										field lines around the torus to look like a candy cane which mean that
										each particle experience the inner strong field and outer weak field.
										The ratio of twists to orbits is known as the safety factor and the
										higher it is, the longer the fusion reactor can be run for.</p>
										<img src="images/nuclearFusion/nfig1.png" style="width: 500px; height: 100;" />

										<img src="images/nuclearFusion/nfig3.png" style="width: 500px; height: 100;" />
										<p>Not every instability in the plasma is solved by tokamaks, for
										example, “banana orbits”. These are a result of the wide range of
										particle energies in a tokamak. Lower-energy particles in the fuel
										reflect off the stronger magnetic field at the inner edge of the torus,
										sending them backwards through the fuel. They then collide with the
										higher energy nuclei and scatter them out of the plasma causing fuel to
										be lost from the reactor. This process is slow enough for practical
										reactors to be attainable. Other instabilities require innovative new
										solutions such as implementing AI algorithms to detect when the plasma
										is reaching a critically unstable state and to cool down or entirely
										shut off the machine to avoid major damage.</p>
										<p>An astonishing fact about tokamaks is that they contain the greatest
										temperature gradient in the known universe with the cooled
										superconducting magnets at –193°C being just metres away from the 150
										million °C plasma (10x hotter than the centre of the sun!).</p>
										<p>This plasma is initially created by running a high-intensity
										electrical current through the deuterium gas which strips the atoms of
										their electrons, resulting in a plasma. The fuel is then brought up to
										fusion temperatures via various methods including:
										<ul><li>Neutral beam
										injection: High energy deuterium particles are accelerated and injected
										into the heart of the plasma where they collide and transfer their
										energy to other particles.</li>
										<li>High-frequency electromagnetic waves:
										High-frequency waves introduced to the plasma increases their energy and
										therefore their velocity.</li></ul></p>
										<p>JT-60SA is currently (as of late 2023) the largest superconducting
										tokamak in the world. It is Japan and Europe’s joint international
										fusion experiment which has successfully produced plasma rings of up to
										<span class="math inline">\(135m^3\)</span>. This project’s successes
										have paved the way and influenced the construction of an even larger
										project in France, ITER which will boast an impressive <span
										class="math inline">\(850m^3\)</span> of space to fill with plasma fuel.
										It will use a fuel combination of two isotopes of hydrogen: deuterium
										harvested from salt water and tritium which can be found in the
										atmosphere.</p>
										<img src="images/nuclearFusion/nfig6.png" style="width: 500px; height: auto;" /><p>-ITER under construction</p>
										<h3 id="inertial confinement">Intertial Confinement:</h3>
										<p>The other major field of research in fusion power generation is
										Inertial Confinement. Instead of creating a ring of plasma and going
										through the great effort of controlling it, Inertial confinement fusion
										compresses and heats small targets filled with fuel. The fuel for these
										powerful reactions are just small pellets typically containing deuterium
										and tritium. If we target a very high energy at the pellets they can be
										compressed and heated sufficiently for fusion to occur.</p>
										<p>The energy and compression is achieved by focusing an array of
										intense laser beam onto the small pellet (1-10mm diameter). Pulses of
										the lasers are organised so that the shocks produced during the
										implosion converge in the centre of the pellet, heating the core to
										fusion temperatures. The burn initiates in the central D-T layer and
										spreads outward as the alpha particles collide with and heat the rest of
										the pellet to a value sufficient to produce fusion reactions. Ignition
										occurs, and the pellet, now a dense plasma, is burned up in a
										small micro explosion while fusion occurs, releasing large amounts of
										energy; Ideally more than is put in. Implosion speed is several hundred
										km/s. </p>
										<p>The NIF (National Ignition Facility) in the US, uses neodymium-doped
										phosphate glass slabs. In the slabs, neodymium atoms are raised to
										higher energy states by intense white light which surrounds them. When
										the laser pulse passes through the glass slabs, the extra energy of the
										phosphate atoms is transferred to the laser beam. The initial weak laser
										pulse starts at just a billionth of a joule and can reach up to 4
										million joules in a few millionths of a second.</p>
										<img src="images/nuclearFusion/nfig7.png" style="width: 500px; height: auto;" /> <p>-NIF target chamber</p>
										The Future of Fusion: To date the NIF is the only
										fusion facility that has produced a net energy gain. Even this success
										is somewhat debated as the input energy they use to calculate the gain
										doesn’t include all of the energy inputs. Advances are constantly being
										made in the field with the goal of supplying essentially unlimited clean
										energy for the entire globe. Achieving this goal would benefit the
										entire world to an incredible extent as it would continue to supply the
										ever-growing demand for energy while lessening our impact on the planet
										by providing a clean energy source with very little waste. The eternal
										joke in fusion energy science is that a functional reactor is just 20
										years away, repeating every 20 years. However, the new ITER tokamak
										project appears to be very promising with some of the brightest
										scientists contributing to its research so we may be seeing many more
										successful results in the near future.</p>
