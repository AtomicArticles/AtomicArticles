										<p>Our modern world is built on semiconducting materials. Without them,
										cheap LED lighting wouldn’t be available to illuminate our rooms and
										screens; solar cells wouldn’t be playing a key role in the energy
										transition; and every single modern device would be impossible to create
										without the billions of structures called transistors. It is safe to say
										that without these materials our current way of living would be
										significantly different. Semiconducting materials are so essential in
										the world of technology that Silicon Valley, the global centre of
										technological innovation, is named after the most commonly used
										semiconductor: Silicon. Gaining a deeper understanding of these
										materials is an interesting way of exploring the combination of
										chemistry and physics that have revolutionised our world.</p>
										<p>The key feature of a semiconductor is that their conductivity is
										uniquely between that of an insulator and a conductor. To understand
										this at a more fundamental level we will explore the electronic
										configuration of these materials:</p>
										<h3 id="energy-bands">Energy bands:</h3>
										<p>Semiconductor’s unique properties are explained by how electrons are
										positioned and move around the structure. Following the exact movement
										of the billions of electrons inside even a small sample of a material is
										not feasible so we’ll start simply by looking at the electronic
										configuration of a single atom. Every electron associated with the atom
										has a specific energy. The energy of a particular electron is said to be
										0 eV (unit like Joules but a lot smaller) when the electron is
										infinitely far from the nucleus (i.e. no interaction between them). As
										the negatively charged electron is brought closer to the positively
										charged protons in nucleus, the opposite charges attract each other
										resulting in a favourable interaction which lowers the energy of the
										system. This gives electrons closer to the nucleus a more negative
										energy which means that more energy needs to be given to the electron
										for it to be freed from the electrostatic attractions. A very important
										detail is the fact that electrons can only occupy specific discrete
										energy levels. The value of these energy levels is defined by the
										principal quantum number which relates to the wavelike nature of
										electrons. Most people understand this through the “Bohr Model” with the
										orbits of electrons being certain distances away. If the lines of the
										orbits are straightened it gives a picture similar to the energy level
										diagram. Electrons can move between these levels by gaining or releasing
										the exact right amount of energy at a single moment. </p>
										<p>In an atom, electrons are contained within atomic orbitals. These are
										regions of space in which up to 2 electrons with opposite spins can
										occupy.   </p>
										<p>Understanding the electronic configuration of a single atom allows us
										to apply our knowledge to a whole system of atoms interacting with each
										other; but let’s start simply with the introduction of 1 extra
										atom: </p>
										<p>Take a single covalently bonded diatomic molecule. The once “atomic”
										orbitals combine to create multiple “molecular” orbitals. We use LCAO
										(”linear combination of atomic orbitals”) to model this process and to
										understand the new shapes of regions which the electrons can occupy,
										however, we are more interested in the energy of each orbital. Simply
										taking 2 atomic orbitals of the same energy level and combining them
										results in the creation of 2 molecular orbitals, one slightly higher in
										energy and one slightly lower in energy. The key qualities of this
										process to note are that the total number of orbitals is conserved and
										that the energy levels of the system fill the shape of a band more as
										more atoms are added. The diatomic system doubled the number of energy
										levels that appeared on our original diagram. When the number of atoms
										is increased to even just a single mole of a substance (6.022*10^24
										atoms), the discrete energy levels begin to look less and less discrete
										and are said to be contained within a “continuous band”. The energy
										level diagram of the system now consists of energy bands which represent
										a continuum of energy levels. </p>
										<p>Electrons occupy the lowest energy state they can and so bands are
										filled from the bottom up. The band of the highest energy that contains
										electrons is called the valence band and the next one above that is the
										conduction band. If the valence band is partially filled then the
										material is classified as a metal. The unoccupied energy levels in the
										partially filled band require a negligible amount of energy to move
										between and so electrons can move very easily throughout the structure.
										This explains metal’s conductive properties. Insulator’s and
										semiconductor’s valence bands are completely filled so much more energy
										is required to promote an electron to the conduction band where it would
										be able to move freely between energy states. What separates these
										materials is the difference in energy between the VBM and CBM.
										Insulators have a very large energy gap so to move electrons to the
										conduction band requires an amount of energy that is incredibly unlikely
										at room temperature. Semiconductors have an energy gap of about 3 eV or
										less. This means that in temperatures a little higher than room
										temperature a number of electrons are able to move freely through the
										structure. This property is what classifies “intrinsic”
										semiconductors. </p>
										<h3 id="doping">Doping:</h3>
										<p>Pure semiconductors, despite being much more conductive than
										insulators, still have very few electrons with enough energy to move
										freely through the structure. At room temperature, the number of
										thermally excited electrons per cm^3 in silicon (Si) is 1.5 × 10^10
										while in a typical metal it is around 10^28 electrons per cm^3. To
										overcome this, the properties of semiconductors can be changed through
										“doping”. This is where a very small amount of an impurity is introduced
										to tune the material’s conductivity. Silicon, being the most common
										example, consists of a regular lattice structure where each atom is
										covalently bonded to 4 other Si atoms. This structure is slightly
										altered via 2 different methods of doping:  </p>
										<p>N-type doping involves the introduction of an impurity with one extra
										electron in its valence shell compared to the main element. The most
										common example of this is the introduction of phosphorous into a silicon
										lattice. P’s extra electron is very weakly bound to it (bond energies on
										order of hundredths of an eV) as it is not contained within a covalent
										bond. They are easily promoted to conduction band with a very small
										amount of energy which is represented on the band diagram as an
										imaginary “donor level” just below the conduction band. They are named
										n-type semiconductors as the majority charge carriers are negatively
										charged electrons.  </p>
										<img src="images/semiconductors/sfig1.png" style="width: 500px; height: auto;" />
										<p>P-type doping introduces an element with one fewer
										electron than the main element (e.g. Al into Si). This creates “holes”
										throughout the structure which are regions of positive charge that can
										be modelled as particles. A new imaginary “acceptor level” is created
										just above the valence band which demonstrates that new holes have been
										created which can facilitate the movement of electrons throughout the
										structure and so the material is now more capable of conducting. This
										system is best imagined by the movement of positively charged holes
										through the structure. The majority charge carriers are now positive
										holes, hence the name p-type semiconductor.  </p>
										<p>These extrinsic semiconductors now have significantly higher
										conductivity at RTP. The intrinsic properties of the semiconductors
										still have an effect but aren’t apparent at lower temperatures as the
										number of charge carriers introduced during doping is so much
										greater. </p>
										<p>One method of doping a semiconductor is ion implantation where
										ionised dopants are accelerated with an electromagnetic field. These are
										directed at the silicon’s surface and penetrate to different depths
										depending on the dopants’ mass and energy. This can damage the surface
										of the semiconductor so to restore it and to further integrate the
										dopant, it is heated to about 1000°C. </p>
										<h3 id="pn-junctions">PN junctions </h3>
										<p>An important structure in the world of semiconductors consists of
										neighbouring regions of p-type and n-type doped semiconductors. Holes
										from the P region can “diffuse” into N region while electrons from the N
										region “diffuse” into P. A region depleted of free charged particles is
										created, aptly named the “depletion region”. In the P side of this
										region, negative ionised impurities appear as electrons have been added
										to fill the shells of the impurity atoms. The opposite happens in the N
										side where positive ionised impurities are created as their extra
										electrons are taken away. This distribution of charges creates an
										electric field which acts as a potential barrier preventing the
										displacement of electrons and holes as it pulls electrons back towards
										the N if they ever start diffusing across. </p>
										<img src="images/semiconductors/sfig2.png" style="width: 500px; height: auto;" />
										<p>When an external voltage is applied, the PN junction
										undergoes different behaviours depending on where the terminals are
										connected. If the positive terminal is connected to the N then electrons
										are drawn out to the battery. The negative terminal then draws out the
										holes leaving a larger depletion region. A new equilibrium is eventually
										reached where the extra charge buildup in the depletion zone can resist
										the pull of the battery so no current flows. When the terminals are
										inverted electrons pushed into N and holes pushed into P, shrinking the
										depletion zone. When the voltage is large enough, electrons jump across
										the depletion zone so a current is established.  </p>
										<p>This is the behaviour of a diode: Current is allowed to flow in only
										one direction through the component. </p>
										<p>Diodes are used in many applications, an everyday example being LEDs.
										When an electron-hole pair combine across the junction, the electron’s
										energy decreases as it moves to a lower energy state which results in
										the release of a photon. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave
										emission is dependant on this energy difference. Different semiconductor
										materials and dopants are used to create a different energy difference
										across the band gaps. Si-based LEDs typically emit infrared. To emit
										visible light, alloys of GaAs or GaP are used for red, orange, and
										yellow while blue is created with GaN. </p>
										<p>A very interesting behaviour comes from reversing the behaviour of
										LEDs. When light is shined onto the diode directly and if the photon has
										enough energy, a new electron-hole pair is produced as the electron is
										promoted to the conductance band. Instead of recombining to use up the
										energy again, electrons are transported to terminals connected to either
										side. The result is the creation of a voltage across a diode. The same
										exact mechanisms illuminating our rooms can be used for clean energy
										generation. Interestingly, when light is shined onto LEDs it generates a
										voltage. But solar cells are much more optimised than just shining a
										light on an LED. Lots of research goes into finding the correct
										combination of materials for maximum energy collection efficiency.  </p>
										<h3 id="transistors">Transistors </h3>
										<img src="images/semiconductors/sfig3.png" style="width: 500px; height: auto;" />
										<p>The most widely recognised role of semiconductors is
										the one they play in every single device that we use. Transistors have
										allowed the widespread use of a range of technologies thanks to the
										miniscule footprint of each one. Billions of these structures fit onto
										one processing chip which allows for complex calculations to be
										completed in a tiny area. The transistors we will explore are MOSFETs
										(metal-oxide-semiconductor-field-effect transistors) which are highly
										efficient transistors and are one of the most commonly used. The
										particular name for the one in the diagram is the “N-channel, depletion
										mode MOSFET” which works as follows: The source (negative terminal) and
										drain (positive terminal) are connected to a section of the
										semiconductor highly concentrated with n-type dopants. The rest of the
										semiconductor material is doped with a lower concentration of p-type. A
										thin insulating oxide layer separates the gate terminal from the
										substrate (semiconductor). A small voltage source’s positive terminal is
										connected to the gate while the negative is connected to the terminal
										attached to the substrate which creates an electric field across the
										substrate. The field exerts a force on electrons towards the insulator
										which results in a channel with free electrons and no holes. This region
										is now considered an n-type semiconductor and connects the n-type
										regions of the source and the drain allowing a current to run through.
										The ability to switch a current between an on and off state with a small
										amount of voltage in such a small space is where the real value of
										semiconductors is found. It allows billions of transistors to fit on a
										single CPU (20 billion on Apple’s M2 chip found in the newest iPads).
										The other important feature is that the output of one can be used
										directly as the input of another transistor so they can all collaborate
										seamlessly.  </p>
										<h3 id="impact on the world">Impact on the world  </h3>
										<p>Semiconductors have been a vital material in constructing the world
										as we know it. Positive environmental impact is where they excel and
										they will continue to be essential in the energy transition. Solar farms
										making can be used to power whole cities in countries with plentiful
										sunlight (England may have to find an alternative) which provides a
										valuable alternative to the filthy energy generated from the burning of
										the fossil fuels that pollute our lands, seas, and skies. Once energy
										storage technology is developed further it may be used as a secure and
										consistent source of power. LED lighting also benefit the environment
										with their superior energy efficiency so less energy is wasted as heat
										(5% energy wasted as heat compared to fluorescent lighting’s 95%
										wasted). They also contain no toxic elements unlike the noxious
										chemicals (e.g. mercury) in fluorescent lighting. Their longer lifespan
										is up to six times longer than other types of lights so less resources
										are required for packaging, materials, and transportation. Finally, the
										most significant contribution of semiconductors to society is in the
										technological realm. The mammoth computational devices that filled
										entire rooms with clicking vacuum tubes have been condensed to the size
										of a postage stamp. It is safe to say that semiconductors are one of the
										most important types of materials; and it all stemmed from a few
										uniquely configured energy bands. </p>
