<h1>Atomic Articles</h1>
<body>
  Welcome to Atomic Articles! I’m a sixth form student studying both physics and chemistry at A Level. These are 2 subjects I’m very passionate about and so I’ve decided to collect all the topics I find particularly interesting to compile into little articles. This website will hopefully very soon be filled with a number of short articles for you to explore and learn something new!
