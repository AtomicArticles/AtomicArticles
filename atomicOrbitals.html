									<h1 id="how-does-quantum-theory-determine-the-shapes-of-atomic-orbitals">How does quantum theory determine the shapes of atomic orbitals?</h1>
<p>Quantum mechanical phenomena are essential in creating a comprehensive picture of the atom. The first thing to understand is that this quantum model depends entirely on probabilities which is in contrast to the widely understood Bohr model. This model predicted defined shells in which electrons can orbit around a nucleus made up of
protons and neutrons (much like the planets around the sun). We now know
the idea of set orbits is false and that electrons surround the atom in
a much less predictable way as dictated by each electron’s wavefunction.
From the wavefunction we can identify regions of space in which we can
find electrons called “Orbitals”. This article focuses on how quantum
numbers are used to identifying the possible positions of electrons and,
as a result, will uncover the true shapes of orbitals in an atom.</p>
<h3 id="wavefunctions-1">Wavefunctions <span
class="math inline">\(^{[1]}\)</span>:</h3>
<p>The shape and size of an orbital is determined with the use of
wavefunctions. These functions can be used to calculate many details of
systems from the momentum of a particle to the motion of ripples on a
body of water. The functions that we will look at only concern the
calculation of electron distributions. Each orbital has a unique
wavefunction associated with it whose parameter (numerical input) is the
position in 3 dimensional space from the nucleus (using spherical
coordinates) and the function outputs a “probability amplitude”. The
Born interpretation of the wavefunction imagines a very small box
centred at coordinates (<span class="math inline">\(r, \theta,
\phi\)</span>). The probability of finding an electron in this small box
is proportional to the square of the wavefunction at this point. So it
is understood that the wavefunction squared is the probability density:
P(electron in box) = <span
class="math inline">\((wavefunction)^2\)</span> * volume of the box.
Each wavefunction is the product of 2 parts: the angular part and the
radial part, however, the full details of how each individual
wavefunction is derived is not covered in this article.</p>
<p>Another useful way of using the electron density is by imagining a
very thin shell centred at radius r from the nucleus. This gives us the
probability that an electron is a certain distance in any direction
around the nucleus which is called the radial distribution function
(Fig. 2). RDF = <span class="math inline">\((wavefunction)^2\)</span> *
<span class="math inline">\(4 \pi r^2\)</span> so the probability of an
electron being in a certain thin shell around the nucleus is the product
of the RDF and the thickness of the shell. For a 1s orbital, the RDF has
a maxima at r = 1 (53pm) which is the same distance as the Bohr radius:
the lowest energy orbit radius in the non-quantum Bohr model. This shows
parallels between the 2 models but it can already be understood that the
quantum model has many more complications. </p>

<h3 id="quantum-numbers">Quantum numbers<span class="math inline">\(^{[2]}\)</span>:</h3>
<p>Quantum numbers are quantities that represent all possible states of a system.
Four of these numbers are required to describe the position, movement
and energy of each electron in an atom. The combination of these quantum
numbers for all electrons in an atom is described by a wavefunction that
complies with the Schrödinger equation.</p>
<p>The first number used is the <strong>principle quantum
number</strong> (n) which can take the value of any positive integer.
This value primarily dictates the energy level of the orbital (so
orbitals with the same n form a shell). The equation describing this
energy is: <span class="math inline">\(E_n = \frac{-R_H}{n^2}\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(R_h\)</span> is the Rydberg constant
and the energy is given in electronvolts (energy is 0 when no
interaction between nucleus and electron i.e. infinite distance between
them). This shows the smaller the principal quantum number, the lower
the energy is and because systems typically assume the lowest energy
state, electrons fill the lowest energy orbitals first. The principle
quantum number also indicates the most probable distance of the electron
from the nucleus and so determines the size of the orbital (Larger n
values mean the electron is more likely to be further away).</p>
<p>The next is <strong>orbital angular momentum quantum number</strong>
(ℓ) with values depending on n: from (n-1) to 0 in integer steps. This
number is used in combination with n to determine the 3-dimensional
shape of any orbital. These numbers are represented by the letters s (ℓ
= 0), p (1), d (2) and f (3) which are used to represent different
shapes of orbitals.</p>
<p>The <strong>magnetic quantum number</strong> (m) has values from ℓ to
-ℓ in integer steps giving the m (2ℓ+1) possible values. This number
describes the orientation of an orbital in space as well as the number
of them within a subshell.</p>
<p>Finally, the <strong>electron spin quantum number</strong> (s) is
independent of the other quantum numbers and doesn’t affect the 3
dimensional shape of the orbital, it only determines the spin of the
electron (<span class="math inline">\(\pm\frac{1}{2}\)</span>). Pauli
Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons can share the same
exact combination of quantum numbers which explains why the number of
electrons in each energy level is limited. The two possible spin quantum
numbers allows up to two electrons to occupy each orbital.</p>
<h3 id="constructing-orbitals">Constructing orbitals:</h3>
<p>We now have all the components necessary to describe the shape and
size of an orbital: Starting with a 1s orbital its wavefunction (<span
class="math inline">\(\Psi_{1s}(r) = Ae^{Br}\)</span> where A and B are
constants<span class="math inline">\(^{[3]}\)</span>) shows that the
shape is entirely spherical as it only depends on distance r from the
nucleus and not any angles. The angle independence is reflected in the
value of m equalling 0 so there is only one possible orientation. This
shape is visualised with cross-sectional diagrams or surface plots as
shown (Fig. 3). The RDF shows that the most likely position of the
electron is a specific distance from the nucleus (1 Bohr radius). Moving
to the next shell introduces more complications and the wavefunction now
gives rise to a radial node in the 2s orbital. This is explained by the
wavefunction graph which intersects with the x-axis at a certain r
(refer to Fig. 1), the probability of finding an electron here is 0.
Although the wavefunction is negative for some values, it is squared
when used as a probability density so electrons are still able to be
found further than the radial node. There is another type of node which
presents itself in the 2p orbital: angular nodes. These occur as a
result of the aforementioned angular component of the wavefunction.
There are 3 possible orientations of the p orbital (as when n=2, ℓ can
equal 0 or 1 and when ℓ=1, m can take the values -1, 0, or 1). Focusing
on the <span class="math inline">\(2p_z\)</span> orbital we find that
there is a angular node when z is 0 (xy-plane is the nodal plane) as the
wavefunction is 0 for all values of x and y (Fig. 3). This arises from
the <span class="math inline">\(cos(\theta)\)</span> within the
wavefunction of <span class="math inline">\(2p_z\)</span>; (<span
class="math inline">\(\Psi_{2p_z} = C[cos\theta][re^{Dr}]\)</span> where
C and D are constants<span class="math inline">\(^{[3]}\)</span>). When
<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(90^o\)</span> the wavefunction is always equal to
0. Between <span class="math inline">\(0^o\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(90^o\)</span>, it is positive and between <span
class="math inline">\(90^o\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(180^o\)</span> it is negative. This creates a
negative and a positive lobe of electron density. These lobes with
opposite signs correspond to the phase of the wave describing the
electron motion and are useful when describing molecular orbitals (those
that illustrate electron position in entire molecules). It should be
noted that the three 2p orbitals only differ in their angular part and
despite the 2p wavelength being 0 at nucleus it is not counted as a
radial node. A general pattern arises when more of these orbitals are
plotted (Fig. 5). The total number of nodes is (n-1) while number of
angular nodes is equal to l and the number of radial nodes is
(n-ℓ-1)<span class="math inline">\(^{[3]}\)</span>. These rules give
rise to many mathematically satisfying diagrams picturing the true
nature of how electrons act inside of atoms.</p>
